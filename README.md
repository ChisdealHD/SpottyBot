## SpottyBot - A Twitch Spotify Bot

## Tracklist updated: 03.10.2015 - Bugs Fixed!

SpottyBot is a Twitch IRC bot for Windows and Mac which plays only TOS compliment music via your desktop Spotify application!  

Recently Twitch announced a list of tracks made available to Twitch broadcasters to use freely in Twitch live and recorded videos using SpottyBot means your VODS should no longer get muted and you can appeal them if they do!

Plus! Users in your Twitch chat room can now control the music playing on your Twitch stream and as a streamer you can be sure you are not breaking any laws or the Twitch terms of service!

SpottyBot allows users in your chat room to control the music via a voting system and discover the currently playing music track! Users can type three commands: !skip, !keep and !song

The current app song list is over 500 songs! [Twitch Music](http://music.twitch.tv)
